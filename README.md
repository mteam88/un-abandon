# Un-Abandon
An orphanage for software. Your place to find or provide abandoned projects.
## What is Un-Abandon?
Un-Abandon is a platform for developers to find abandoned projects and take over the development of them. 

Have you ever found yourself losing the motivation to work on a software project mere days after starting?
Maybe you have a great idea for a project but you don't have the time to work on it?

You may be suffering from clinical software abandonment syndrome (SAS.) Our labs have researched possible cures for SAS, and our experts agree:

Un-Abandon is the place for you. Keep reading to find out how **you** can act.

## How does it work?
Developers abandon a project and post it on Un-Abandon. Other developers can then take over the project and continue development.
There are two main roles on Un-Abandon: **Givers** and **Takers**. Both are key to the Un-Abandon ecosystem, and it is recommended that developers embrace both roles.

## A Simple Example
Meet Bob. Bob is a grown man with 4 kids but no time. He has a great idea for a software project, but he doesn't have the time to work on it. He posts his project on Un-Abandon and waits for someone to take over.

Now meet Alice. Alice is a young developer with a lot of free time. She is looking for a project to work on. She finds Bob's project on Un-Abandon and decides to take it over. She now has a project to work on, and Bob has sent his idea to the world.
